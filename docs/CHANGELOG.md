- Fix: Minor script tweaks to make it a little more resilient

### v1.1.0 - Autopatching

https://github.com/mikehdt/aws-foundry-ssl/releases/tag/v1.1.0

- New: Amazon Linux 2023 kernel auto-updating

### v1.0.0 - Initial Rework

https://github.com/mikehdt/aws-foundry-ssl/releases/tag/v1.0.0

- New: Send certbot's update logs to CloudWatch
- New: Can choose to _not_ request LetsEncrypt TLS if you're trying to get it to deploy and you don't want to run into the certificate issuance limit. See https://letsencrypt.org/docs/duplicate-certificate-limit/
- Fix: S3 bucket ACL permissions were updated for the stricter [default policy](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/12/amazon-s3-automatically-enable-block-public-access-disable-access-control-lists-buckets-april-2023/) as of circa April 2023
- Fix: S3 permissions and configuration was changed in Foundry 11
- Fix: New default AMI security seems to necessitate `sudo` in the install script
- Fix: LetsEncrypt TLS certbot didn't work on initial startup
- Fix: Seemed to be a conflict between running the install scripts on the EC2 and CloudFormation setting up the DNS
- Fix: Fixed legacy option warning in `certbot`'s CLI call
- Fix: Some AWS Route53 issues where a `.` needed to be on the end of the domain
- Uplift: `yum` calls were changed use `dnf`. `yum` itself [is deprecated](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/yum) in favour of `dnf`.
- Uplift: All legacy `crontab` timers have been migrated to [`systemd` timers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/Timers)
- Uplift: Node install script [was deprecated](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions); Instead it installs with `dnf`
- Uplift: `amazon-linux-extras` [no longer exists](https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2023/faqs/); Instead it installs `nginx` with `dnf`
- Uplift: Tidied up some other bits and pieces, added a few extra echoes to help diagnose logging
- Uplift: `t4g` instances are cheaper for very similar workloads so they're now the default, `t3a` instances are still available
  - Foundry would _just_ run on a `.micro` instance, but it'd also run out of memory and cause the EC2 to freak out. This resulted in CPU usage (and hosting costs) to spiral out of control, so that size has been removed
  - `m6`-class instances added for people who are made of moneybags, replacing the older `m4` instances

### Removed Features

- Removed code for dealing with non-AWS registrars, as I don't have the means or time to support them
  - If you use a non-AWS registrar, you probably know what you're doing and can re-implement or configure it
